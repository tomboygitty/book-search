# Project Name
Google Books Search

## Description
This is a React-based app that searches the Google Books API and displays the results. Books can be saved to an API server.

## Motivation
To learn about React states and components. To gain experience with API calls.

## Results
The app is mostly successful. Books can be searched and one book can be saved to the server.

## Individual Responsibilities
This project was entirely coded by Tom Elliott.

### Challenges
The biggest challenge in this project was creating the right file structure/planning. Also, getting the right React component states to pass.

## Improvements
Have the Save function be fully functional, i.e. can search and save multiple books instead of just one.
